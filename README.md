# OrangeHRMSelenium

Hello People. This is my (I don't know how many, but I swear this is the last one) Selenium Repo I've created. 
This time on [OrangeHRM](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login). I will try to cover most, if not all, possible cases here.
For test cases, follow the [Spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dTe3NJP8LX2N0wKQZg7yIaR8OqUTjoe00XpayBe6O-0/edit?usp=sharing).

Hopefully, I can make it just like the definitely-not-famous saying, 'one commit a day keep the opportunities close!'
